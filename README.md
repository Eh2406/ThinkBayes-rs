ThinkBayes-rs
===========

This is a unofficial rewrite of [Allen B. Downey's ThinkBayes](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes) in to [Rust](rust-lang.org).

This has several goals:

1. To be a clean port of ThinkBayes.py. So that the book can easily be followed in Rust code.
2. To be Rusty, demonstrating and using good Rust practises.

These goals do not always align, but we will jump off that bridge when we come to it.

Issues, Pull Request, Comments, spelling mistakes, and Questions all welcome.
